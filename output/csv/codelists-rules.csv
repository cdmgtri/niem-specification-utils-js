- Code list identifier: Candidate code list identifiers for the document are the values for CanonicalUri, CanonicalVersionUri, and LocationUri defined by the Genericode document for the code list. 
- Distinct entries: Each row of the Genericode code list document constitutes a distinct entry. 
- Code values: Each Value element of the Genericode code list document corresponds to a code value. 
- Column names: The columns are as defined by Genericode; the column name of a column is the value of attribute Id of that column. 
- A column in a Genericode code list document is a well-known column when its value for CanonicalUri or CanonicalVersionUri corresponds to the code list identifier specified for that well-known column. 
- A reference to column #code is matched, in order, to: a column corresponding to well-known column code, a column with column name code, the column in the first single-column key for the code list, or the first column in the code list. 
- a column corresponding to well-known column code, 
- a column with column name code, 
- the column in the first single-column key for the code list, or 
- the first column in the code list. 
- A code value in a Genericode file has a type as specified by the data definition of its column. If the Type attribute references an element declaration, then the type is the type of that element. If a Parameter, which introduces gc:DatatypeFacet, is used, then the type is treated as an anonymous type derived from the type of the column. A value for which no data type is specified has an empty data type.",true
